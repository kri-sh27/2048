# Getting Started with 2048 | CI/CD Pipeline Automation



This game (2048) was built using **React** and **TypeScript**. The unique part of this example is animations. The animations in React aren't that straightforward, so I hope you can learn something new from it.



<!-- ## How To Play? -->

<!-- You can play 2048 on [Github pages](https://mateuszsokola.github.io/2048-in-react/) -->

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
